                    <h3>Fantasy Football Draft Assistant</h3>
                    <p>The Fantasy Football Draft Assistant is an interactive Python tool built to help players make informed decisions during a live fantasy football draft. The app ingests ESPN and CSV datasets, normalizes player statistics, applies custom scoring rules, and ranks players across positions such as QB, RB, WR, TE, and K. Using Streamlit for the interface, it provides real-time updates, visibility into positional depth, and dynamic value calculations. This project highlights my strengths in data manipulation, user-focused design, and building fast, interactive tools for real use cases.</p>

                    <h3>Resume Scorer and Interview Question Generator</h3>
                    <p>This project is a Python-based desktop application designed to help job seekers strengthen their resumes. It parses PDF resumes, extracts structured text, and compares the content against a target job description to evaluate keyword alignment. The app generates a score out of 100 and offers tailored feedback on strengths, weaknesses, and missing skills. It also produces customized interview questions based on detected gaps in experience. Built using PyMuPDF for PDF parsing, JSON for data structuring, and Tkinter for the GUI, the tool demonstrates my ability to develop full-stack desktop applications with text processing, scoring algorithms, and clean UI components.</p>
